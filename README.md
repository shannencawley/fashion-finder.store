# fashion-finder.store

Fashion Finder is a senior capstone project completed over the course of two semesters by Shannen Cawley, Eve Collier, Estella Mercado, and Kate Fedotova.
It aims to bridge the gap between fashion and social media with an experience-oriented design aimed to engage users with inspiring fashion. You can shop
for items on our platform with the integration of the Google Programmable Search API and interactive elements were implemented to create that social media
aspect to our platform. Your data is securely stored and managed using phpMyAdmin and the layout and design of the UI brings it all together.

We are very excited for you to see our work all throughout 2024. Here are some visuals of our platform, we hope you enjoy!

At the time I am writing this, you are able to visit our web app through the URL below, but it may be taken down in the near future. Feel free to explore on there:

We were fortunate enough to be invited to a netoworking conference, hosted by WISDOM, to present our project.
